'''
You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish Notation.

Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

Note that:

The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
There will not be any division by zero.
The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:
Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9

Example 2:
Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
Output: 6
Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6

#Solution 1:
#O(n) time: iterate through tokens, and utilize stack
#O(n) space: at most n/2 tokens in stack

class Solution:
    def evalRPN(self, tokens: List[str]) -> int:
        stack = []

        for token in tokens:
            if token == "+":
                stack.append(stack.pop() + stack.pop())
            elif token == "-":
                a, b = stack.pop(), stack.pop()
                stack.append(b - a)
            elif token == "*":
                stack.append(stack.pop() * stack.pop())
            elif token == "/":
                a, b = stack.pop(), stack.pop()
                stack.append(int(b/a))
            else:
                stack.append(int(token))
        return stack[-1]
