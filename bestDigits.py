"""
Write a function that takes a positive integer represented as a string "number" and an integer "numDigits". Remove numDigits from the string so that the number represented by string is as large as possible afterwards

Note that the order of the remaining digits cannot be changed. You can assume numDigits will always be less than the length of number and greater than or equal to 0

Sample:
Input:
number =  "462839"
numDigits = 2

Output:
"6839"
